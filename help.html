        <h5>Is my source code being uploaded somewhere?</h5>
        <p>Not at all. Quickscan calculates fingerprints for your source code and sends them to the scanning for
          comparison. Those
          fingerprints cannot be reversed into the source code. You can see the fingerprints from the File – Scan List –
          Download
          WFP. Quickscan and the entire SCANOSS platform is Open Source and the source code can be found in
          <a href="https://github.com/scanoss">SCANOSS GitHub organisation</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row intro-body">
        <h5>How are the fingerprints being calculated?</h5>
        <p>Sourcecode fingerprints are calculated using an open source algorithm. A good explanation of the algorithm as
          well as
          the actual implementation can be found here:

        <h5>Why do I get less than 100% OSS matches when scanning an OSS component?</h5>
        <p>Our engine focuses solely on the identification of software, in source code or binary forms. OSS components
          usually
          contain a number of files that are not analyzed, such as configuration files, documents, media files, sample
          data files,
          etc. There are also source files that contain only headers or not enough information to be sampled. </p>

      <div class="row intro-body">
        <h5>Why do i see snippets with 0% or 100%?</h5>
        <p>It is possible to see values of 0% and 100% to represent the snippet range due to roundup.</p>

      <div class="row intro-body">
      <h5>Why is my project not there?</h5>
      <p>Our mining network is automatically discovering new OSS components, which are also automatically downloaded into
      periodic updates to the Knowledgebase. If you believe that the OSSKB is missing something, please feel free to report it
      by emailing us to <a href="mailto:support@scanoss.com">support@scanoss.com</a></p>
